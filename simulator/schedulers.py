"""Module containing the priority functions that influence scheduling.

Each priority function takes a DAG and statically computes the
priority of each task (vertex).

As the simulator uses a min-heap to implement the priority queue,
negative values should be used when higher values represent higher
priorities.

Implemented functions: priority_by_{id, topological_order}
Functions with interfaces but no implementation:
    priority_by_{lpt, spt, successors, hlf, cp}

    The algorithm is thought for unitary tasks and precedence trees.
    It is supposed to be adapted here to work with any kind of graph.

    Critical Path scheduling is described in Chapter 7.4.4 in

    The critical path of a vertex here is to be computed based on
    the value of its bottom level. Chapter 7.3 in the same book explains how
    to compute the top and bottom levels of vertices.
